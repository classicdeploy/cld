Module for `protect network ports` of servers, with the ability to `access only by allowed lists` of ip addresses, as well as `blocking all connections` to any of the servers using `prohibited lists` of ip addresses

The module is a centralized system for managing access lists to instances managed by CLD. The main recommended module is to provide controlled and secure user access to instances. In addition, the module implements the functionality of managing secure access between instances to allow the required services and services. This module has a fairly wide range of applications:
1. Allows you to completely restrict access to your instances, in parallel forming and updating the list of allowed IP addresses for connection.
2. Implements functionality that allows you to delimit access to a list or even a range of ports.
3. Has the ability to customize the rules for accessing instances under CLD control and allows you to define a list of protected ports for connection to each of the instances.
